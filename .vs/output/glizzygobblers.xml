            This is your game class. This is an entity that is created serverside when
            the game starts, and is replicated to the client. 
            
            You can use this to create things like HUDs and declare which player class
            to use for spawned players.
            
            Your game needs to be registered (using [Library] here) with the same name 
            as your game addon. If it isn't then we won't be able to find it.
